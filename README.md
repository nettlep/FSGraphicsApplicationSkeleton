# Legacy Code Resurrection Project

This file is part of a glorious rescue mission: migrating ancient code from the dusty vaults of the internet to the shiny halls of GitHub.

This code has been preserved as faithfully as possible, warts and all. All code contained herein is original code written by Paul Nettle unless otherwise noted.

## Original Description

This is a small skeleton application, great for just playing around with graphics. It gives the programmer access to a frame buffer and a very simple architecture for displaying that frame buffer to the screen.

This project also includes an accurate software polygon renderer for those that need it, or those that are looking to understand the rendering process at a greater level of detail.

## Why preserve this?

Because history matters. This code is a snapshot of how things were done back then—and in some cases, how they’re still done today. Think of it as open source time travel.

Happy coding!
